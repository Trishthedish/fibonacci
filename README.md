# Fibonacci

## Notes on Fibonacci Sequence
- The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical algorithm where each number is the sum of the previous two. That is every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones.
- So, we'll have to add the two previous numbers to calculate the next value.
    - 1 + 1 = 2 (this is our 3rd value)
    - 1 + 2 = 3 (4th)
    - 2 + 3 = 5 (5th)
    - 3 + 5 = 8 (6th)
    - 5 + 8 = 13 (7th)

### _Recursive Solution_
demonstrates that as long as n is a relatively small number, we wonâ€™t really run into any problems. However, our fibonacci method has an exponential runtime. As the input n increases, it will take more and more time to run the method.

Problem each operation contains 2 sub-operations.

### _Cache Solution_
Sacrifice some disk space as we hold on to data longer, but it will be able to evaluate inputs significantly faster.

### _Constructive Solution_
