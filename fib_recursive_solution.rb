# This graphical demonstration of runtimes (also known as Big-O notation) demonstrates that as long as n is a relatively small number, we wonâ€™t really run into any problems
# Our fibonacci method has an exponential runtime, meaning that as the input n increases, it will take more and more time to run the method
